'Template.pdf' is the final report. 
'Comparison of test and train error.ipynb' produce the Figure 3, Figure 4, and Table 1. 
'Comparison of warm start SVD.ipynb' produce the Figure 2. 
'Comparison of time.ipynb' produce the Figure 1. 
All algorithms are implemented by Class. We import 'Methods.py' to import these classes. To check them, you can look 'Methods.ipynb'.
